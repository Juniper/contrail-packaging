# and places the JSON from that file into vendor_data.json and
# vendor_data2.json.
#
# DynamicJSON is configured via the vendordata_dynamic_targets flag, which is
# documented separately. For each of the endpoints specified in that flag, a

# or capability updates in a while. Options include
# mute_weight_multiplier (multiplier for mute children; value
# should be negative).
#
# ram_by_instance_type: Select cells with the most RAM capacity
# for the instance type being requested. Because higher weights
# win, Compute returns the number of available units for the
# instance type requested. The ram_weight_multiplier option defaults
# to 10.0 that adds to the weight by a factor of 10. Use a negative
# number to stack VMs on one host instead of spreading out new VMs

[metrics]
#
# Configuration options for metrics
#
# Options under this group allow to adjust how values assigned to metrics are
# calculated.

#
# From nova.conf
#

#
# When using metrics to weight the suitability of a host, you can use this
# option
# to change how the calculated weight influences the weight assigned to a host
# as
# follows:
#
# * >1.0: increases the effect of the metric on overall weight
# * 1.0: no change to the calculated weight
# * >0.0,<1.0: reduces the effect of the metric on overall weight
# * 0.0: the metric value is ignored, and the value of the
#   'weight_of_unavailable' option is returned instead
# * >-1.0,<0.0: the effect is reduced and reversed
# * -1.0: the effect is reversed
# * <-1.0: the effect is increased proportionally and reversed
#
# This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
# a different scheduler, this option has no effect.
#
# Possible values:
#
# * An integer or float value, where the value corresponds to the multipler
#   ratio for this weigher.
#
# Related options:
#
# * weight_of_unavailable
#  (floating point value)
#weight_multiplier=1.0

#
# This setting specifies the metrics to be weighed and the relative ratios for
# each metric. This should be a single string value, consisting of a series of
# one or more 'name=ratio' pairs, separated by commas, where 'name' is the name
# of the metric to be weighed, and 'ratio' is the relative weight for that
# metric.
#
# Note that if the ratio is set to 0, the metric value is ignored, and instead
# the weight will be set to the value of the 'weight_of_unavailable' option.
#
# As an example, let's consider the case where this option is set to:
#
#     ``name1=1.0, name2=-1.3``
#
# The final weight will be:
#
#     ``(name1.value * 1.0) + (name2.value * -1.3)``
#
# This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
# a different scheduler, this option has no effect.
#
# Possible values:
#
# * A list of zero or more key/value pairs separated by commas, where the key is
#   a string representing the name of a metric and the value is a numeric weight
#   for that metric. If any value is set to 0, the value is ignored and the
#   weight will be set to the value of the 'weight_of_unavailable' option.
#
# Related options:
#
# * weight_of_unavailable
#  (list value)
#weight_setting =

#
# This setting determines how any unavailable metrics are treated. If this
# option
# is set to True, any hosts for which a metric is unavailable will raise an
# exception, so it is recommended to also use the MetricFilter to filter out
# those hosts before weighing.
#
# This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
# a different scheduler, this option has no effect.
#
# Possible values:
#
# * True or False, where False ensures any metric being unavailable for a host
#   will set the host weight to 'weight_of_unavailable'.
#
# Related options:
#
# * weight_of_unavailable
#  (boolean value)
#required=true

#
# When any of the following conditions are met, this value will be used in place
# of any actual metric value:
#
# * One of the metrics named in 'weight_setting' is not available for a host,
#   and the value of 'required' is False
# * The ratio specified for a metric in 'weight_setting' is 0
# * The 'weight_multiplier' option is set to 0
#
# This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
# a different scheduler, this option has no effect.

# The class of the driver used by the scheduler.
#
# The options are chosen from the entry points under the namespace
# 'nova.scheduler.driver' in 'setup.cfg'.
#
# Possible values:
#
# * A string, where the string corresponds to the class name of a scheduler
#   driver. There are a number of options available:
# ** 'caching_scheduler', which aggressively caches the system state for better
#    individual scheduler performance at the risk of more retries when running
#    multiple schedulers
# ** 'chance_scheduler', which simply picks a host at random
# ** 'fake_scheduler', which is used for testing
# ** A custom scheduler driver. In this case, you will be responsible for

#
# Periodic task interval.
#
# This value controls how often (in seconds) to run periodic tasks in the

# the particular scheduler being used.
#
# If this is larger than the nova-service 'service_down_time' setting, Nova may
# report the scheduler service as down. This is because the scheduler driver is

#
# This value controls how often (in seconds) the scheduler should attempt

#
# Small deployments may want this periodic task enabled, as surveying the
# cells for new hosts is likely to be lightweight enough to not cause undue

# race in some conditions, for example in reboot operations or when the compute
# service or when host is rebooted (planned or due to an outage). If such races
# are common, then it is advisable to disable this feature.

#
# Number of seconds to wait for agent's reply to a request.
#
# Nova configures/performs certain administrative actions on a server with the
# help of an agent that's installed on the server. The communication between
# Nova and the agent is achieved via sharing messages, called records, over
# xenstore, a shared storage across all the domains on a Xenserver host.
# Operations performed by the agent on behalf of nova are: 'version','
# key_init',
# 'password','resetnetwork','inject_file', and 'agentupdate'.
#
# To perform one of the above operations, the xapi 'agent' plugin writes the
# command and its associated parameters to a certain location known to the
# domain
# and awaits response. On being notified of the message, the agent performs
# appropriate actions on the server and writes the result back to xenstore. This
# result is then read by the xapi 'agent' plugin to determine the
# success/failure
# of the operation.
#
# This config option determines how long the xapi 'agent' plugin shall wait to
# read the response off of xenstore for a given request/command. If the agent on
# the instance fails to write the result in this time period, the operation is
# considered to have timed out.

#

# agent is available/operational to perform other requests such as
# 'resetnetwork', 'password', 'key_init' and 'inject_file'. If the 'version'
